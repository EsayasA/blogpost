This project helps users to stay informed about weather conditions and make better decisions based on that information<br>and The team members are Esayas Aregawi and Rahwa Legesse since the project is mainly focused on front end design<br> 
we worked together as a team.Thus uses for all customers over the world

## story why we select to work on this project
When I was At compus  almost all my Friends ware software Engineering students.<br>so when they talk about their projects I was wonder how is  this possible. <br>But at that time I was on another department  and  I have not enough time to study both the departments at the same time.<br>so I decide to finish the department I was started then I was planning to study  software Engineering. <br>I was watching  them working a lot of project but I was shock the project they were talking about the weather application.<br>it riases a lot of questions about the weather application.<br>like how is the accourate data comes from, how it works for all the cities of the world,<br> how do I know the weat
hers of the cities and other lot of questions.<br>so at that time I decide if I start learnig software Engineering weather application will be my first project.

## **  we use the following Technologies for our portofilo project**
The above image is the graphics part or the front end part
3.2) frontend (HTML, CSS) and User interface and user experience (UI/UX)
   Backend (JavaScript and API weathermap)
  After that we will use tester
3.3 Provide an overview of 1-3 features youâ€™ve completed.
The website is responsive and compatible with mobile. This means users can access the project from a mobile view.
The website works for all locations of the world.
The website is easy for users to access.it has not login(logout)part.so it takes little time to understand and access
After we finish our front end part, we decide to go fetching of data from ApI sources like Api open weathermap.<br>then we enter to the website of Api weathermap and we create Account first and verify our email.<br> Then we create key value after that we go to the ApI and we select the Current Weather Data API DOC.After we enter to that page we need to select the Api<br> with city name, but there was no Api call with city name. But we watch a lot of videos with the page of Api call with city name. so this was one of our first technical challenge<br>. But we continue using with longitude and latitude of the city to get the data of<br> the cities temperature, pressure, speed, humidty and others using the images of the above lists features. So we copy <br>the Api call and the keyvalue and we toke these values to the browser. We never realized that it takes about 15 minute to fetch API data. We thought that was error <br>and we tried to solve it.that was very challenging until we got sources from YouTube.
